# Dynamic Pricing System

An algorithmic pricing system that automatically adjusts product prices based on market conditions, competitor pricing, inventory levels, and demand patterns.

## Features

### Price Analysis

- **Market Rate Tracking**: Monitor market prices for similar products
- **Competitor Price Tracking**: Track competitor pricing through API integrations
- **Cost-based Pricing**: Calculate appropriate markups based on COGS
- **Historical Price Analysis**: Analyze price trends over time

### Dynamic Price Adjustments

- **Automatic Price Updates**: Adjust prices in real-time based on configurable rules
- **Scheduled Updates**: Configure regular price update intervals
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Apply seasonal pricing models based on historical data

- **Demand-based Pricing**: Increase prices for high-demand products

### Integration

- **Shopify Integration**: Seamless integration with Shopify products and variants
- **Wholesale Channel Pricing**: Configure different pricing strategies for wholesale channels
- **Notification System**: Alerts for significant price changes or rule conflicts
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track pricing performance and rule effectiveness

## Architecture

The system is built around four core components:

1. **Data Collector**: Gathers market data, competitor prices, and internal metrics
2. **Rules Engine**: Processes collected data against configured pricing rules
3. **Price Calculator**: Determines optimal prices based on rules evaluation
4. **Integration Layer**: Updates prices in e-commerce platforms and notifies stakeholders

## Setup

1. Configure data sources in `sources.json`:
   - Competitor websites
   - Market price APIs
   - Internal cost data

2. Set up pricing rules in `rules.json`

3. Configure Shopify API credentials in `credentials.json`

4. Run the pricing system:
```bash
python dynamic_pricing.py
```
